        introduce myself. My name is Matt Quinn. Greg Bastis and I worked together at Patch, 
        where I was the team&apos;s frontend software engineer. Greg told me that you have a customer who needed a Sankey Diagram,
         and I figured that I might be able to help.
        </div>
        <div className="font-light italic">Although I was unfamiliar with Vega and Vega Lite, I&apos;ve never let that stop me before. I found a reddit post linking to an example of a Sankey Diagram that I could use as a starting point. After that, it was off to the races.
        </div>
        <div className="font-light italic">Greg says amazing things about Omni, and it sounds like you all might be in the market for some help on the frontend before long.

        <div className="font-light italic">I&apos;d love <a className="underline text-pink-500" href="https://cal.com/matt-quinn">connect</a> and see if there&apos;s a fit - and in the meantime, hope this Sankey makes a helpful contribution to satisfying your customer requirements.</div>
