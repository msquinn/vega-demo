        <div className="font-light italic">Greg Bastis is making sales and he hasn&apos;t even started yet! Allow me to
        introduce myself. My name is Matt Quinn. I am a software engineer who spent the past several months
        working with Greg at Patch. As you can tell, we approach problem solving with a tenacity to find solutions. I can vouch
        that Greg is an amazing co-worker who is always willing to help and is a great team player. I am confident that he would
        be a fantastic asset to your team. Given the opportunity I would work with him in a heartbeat. If you&apos;re
        impressed by what you see and you&apos;re in the market for a software engineer, I would love to chat with you about Omni.

        <div className="font-light italic">I hope you enjoy the Sankey Diagram. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</div>
